      <h2>Elon Musk</h2>
      <p><strong>Author:</strong> Walter Isaacson</p>
      <p>
        Elon does more to promote humanity than anyone in the world. Renewable
        energy, space travel, and free speech are all huge net positive brought
        upon the world by him, yet he is seemingly criticized and attacked more
        than anybody. Based human.

    <div class="book">
      <h2>Sapiens</h2>
      <p><strong>Author:</strong> Yuval Noah Harari</p>
      <p>
        Sapiens showed me all the default programming I had around thinking
        humans are the most important thing on earth, when considering the
        length of time earth has been around, humans have barely been and will
        eventually cease to be around, just as 99.9% of the species before it
        have.

    <div class="book">
      <h2>Models</h2>
      <p><strong>Author:</strong> Mark Manson</p>
      <p>
        Models helped me be me, because the most attractive version of myself to
        others is the most authentic one.

    <div class="book">
      <h2>Lying</h2>
      <p><strong>Author:</strong> Sam Harris</p>
      <p>
        Lying, even in small ways, corrodes relationships and societal trust. We
        should all be more radically honest.

    <div class="book">
      <h2>Factfulness</h2>
      <p><strong>Author:</strong> Hans Rosling</p>
      <p>
        If for nothing else than showing me how people use data to manipulate
        our perspectives and serve their narratives, factfulness is good for
        cutting through emotional statements about the world and giving you data
        to think about it.

    <div class="book">
      <h2>Calypso</h2>
      <p><strong>Author:</strong> David Sedaris</p>
      <p>Calypso is laugh out loud funny, just read it.</p>
